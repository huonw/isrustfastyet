Monitors the performance of Rust master.

Heavily inspired by arewefastyet.com (including borrowing JS and
CSS!).

A fairly quick hack: doesn't do anything fancy, just hits the buildbot
JSON api and puts it into a database, and then (separately) constructs
a JSON file (`perf.js`, which sets the `PERF_DATA` global variable).

It also collects data from some benchmarkers to disable detailed
memory vs time profiles as well as accurate build speeds.

Requires Python 3 and the requests library.
